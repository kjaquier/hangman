Client-Server dialog
====================

Client add parameter with a value in their httpRequest (GET).
Server reponse is just Text, because of the HTTP protocol.
So it means that client request the server, and then receive a string from the server.

Format
------

### Request

Requests to the server are just HTTP GET requests.

There are two parameters :

* `new` : ask the server to create a new game. The value can be anything, it won't be used.
* `letter` : submit a letter for the current word. A game must already be running. The value is a char from A to Z, and it's not case-sensitive.

A request can be either a *new* request or a *letter* request, not both.

### Response

The server response is always as the following :

	<word>;<state>;<tries>
	
where :

* `<word>` is the discovered part of the word in the current game. Undiscovered letters are replaced by an underscore. For example : `FOOBAR` make `_OO_AR` if `F` and `B` are not yet discovered.
* `<state>` is empty unless the game is starting or finishing. 
	* `game-start` confirms the game has just been initialized.
	* `game-over` means the player lost the game by using all his tries.
	* `you-win` means the player has found the word and the game is over.
* `<tries>` is the number of remaining tries. A try reprensents the submitting of one letter.
