    <h1>App Stores</h1>
    <p class='sideimage'><img src='egghead.jpg'/></p>
    <ul><li>Traditionally, independent software vendors (ISVs) produced and distributed software directly to end users</li>
      <li>Disadvantage: installation, update, license enforcement was reinvented by each ISV</li>
      <li>Linux package managers unify installation and update</li>
      <li>Apple introduces app store with iPhone 2</li>
      <li>Apple reviews apps before making them available</li>
      <li>Apple handles billing and takes a percentage of the price</li>
      <li>Android, Blackberry, Windows 8 have their own stores</li>
      <li>Sony, Samsung, Amazon, etc. etc. try the same with limited success</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>The App Store Business Model</h1>
    <ul><li>Developer pays annual fee ($99)</li>
      <li>Apple charges 30% for services (review, hosting, billing)</li>
      <li>Over 800,000 apps available</li>
      <li>In 2011, Apple paid $2B to developers</li>
      <li>Most non-game apps sell for $1, most games for $2</li>
      <li>12% of apps earn $50K or more, 68% of developers earn &lt; $5K (<a href='http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/05/ios-app-success-is-a-lottery-and-60-of-developers-dont-break-even/'>Source</a>)</li>
      <li>It costs at least $100K to make a competitive iOS app (Source <a href='http://thegamebakers.com/money-and-the-app-store-a-few-figures-that-might-help-an-indie-developer.html'>Source</a>, with interesting data)</li>
      <li>In Android, most apps are free and ad-supported</li>
      <li>Get paid roughly $1 per 1,000 ad views</li>
      <li>It works for Apple and Google, so it probably won't change</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The Walled Garden</h1>
    <p class='sideimage'><img src='walled-garden.jpg'/></p>
    <ul><li>Traditionally, consumers can install any app on their computer</li>
      <li>Disadvantage: Security, quality risks</li>
      <li>With app store, Apple is sole gatekeeper to iOS apps</li>
      <li>Critera include:
          <ul><li>No sex, violence, drugs</li>
            <li>Must feel like an app, not a web page</li>
            <li>Must not crash</li>
            <li>No programmability</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Can't run <a href='http://www.scratch.org/'>Scratch</a> on an iPad (<a href='http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/04/apple-scratch-app/'>Source</a>)</li>
        <li>Apple has kept apps off the app store that compete with its business</li>
        <li>Android: Users can choose to install apps from other sources</li>       
    </ul>

    <h1>Is it Your Phone?</h1>
    <p class='sideimage'><img src='sodastream-jet-black-300.jpg'/></p>
    <ul><li>Can Apple legally stop you from putting an app on your phone?</li>
      <li>No absolute right to do with your equipment what you want</li>
      <li>Ex: The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act'>DCMA</a> makes it illegal to circumvent copyright restrictions, even if you own the device and media</li>      
      <li>Cell phone companies can restrict your ability to unlock a phone, even after the contract is up. (Obama doesn't like it.)</li>
      <li>Game console makers can stop you from running an alternate OS</li>
      <li>Generally, device is considered a part of a “system”</li>
      <li>Not all “systems” claims work. Ex. Lexmark's attempt to use the DCMA to shut out ink refills</li>
      <li>Currently, only legal restriction is antitrust law</li>
      <li>Some efforts to assert against Apple (<a href='http://venturebeat.com/2011/02/17/apple-subscriptions-antitrust-investigation/'>subscriptions</a>, <a href='http://venturebeat.com/2010/09/09/apple-loses-game-of-chicken-allows-flash-and-other-conversion-tools-for-ios-apps/'>conversion tools</a>)</li>
    </ul>
      
    <h1>What is a Monopoly?</h1>
    <p class='sideimage'><img src='Monopoly_board_on_white_bg.jpg'/></p>
    <ul><li>Monopoly: Sole source of good or service</li>
      <li>Not in itself illegal</li>
      <li>In U.S., illegal to exploit monopoly in one area to gain an unfair advantage in another</li>
      <li>Ex. Microsoft was convicted for using its OS monopoly to unfairly interfere in the market for web browsers (“cutting off Netscape's air supply”)</li>
      <li>Apple has no monopoly on cell phone OS</li>
      <li>It's also illegal to collude with other oligopolists to manipulate prices</li>
      <li>Apple <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/technology/judge-rules-against-apple-in-e-books-trial.html'>was found to illegally collude with publishers</a> to set e-book prices</li>

      <li>Must have “distinctive character” (E.g. Windows is not a Ⓡ)</li> 
      <li>Must be used (but abandoned marks are not automatically in the public domain)</li> 
      <li>Must not become generic (e.g. Aspirin in U.S.)</li> 
    </ul> 

    <h1>Trade Secret</h1> 
    <p class='sideimage'><img src='lg_coca-cola_classic_bottle.jpg' alt=''/></p>

        <p>- scientific truths or mathematical expressions</p>

    <h1>Patenting Rounded Corners</h1>
    <p class='sideimage'><img src='rounded-corners.png' alt=''/></p> 
    
    <ul><li>Apple and Samsung <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.,_Ltd.'>sued each other</a> in many courts around the world</li>
      <li>In a lawsuit filed in San Jose, Apple asserts a <a href='http://www.google.com/patents/USD593087'>design patent on rounded corners</a>, as well as patents describing a “bounce back effect” (later invalidated by the USPTO), “tap to zoom”, and “on-screen icons”</li>
      <li>In August 2012, a jury of twelve citizens awards Apple $1.049 billion dollars in damages</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Can You Copyright A Programming Language?</h1>

    <p class='sideimage'><img src='123_release_1.png'/></p>
    <ul><li>In 2010, Oracle sued Google for its use of Java in Android</li>
      <li>Oracle claimed infringement of multiple patents. The judge made Oracle  focus on the strongest two, 6061520 (Method and system for performing static initialization), and RE38104 (Method and apparatus for resolving data references in generated code). The jury found that, on narrow technical grounds, Android didn't infringe either</li>      
      <li>Most of the Java library was rewritten by the Apache Harmony project</li>
      <li>A very small number of files was decompiled from Oracle code, and the parties agreed on $0 in damages</li>
      <li>Oracle claimed that the API was copyrighted, but the judge ruled that the API was "system or method of operation" and thus inherently non-copyrightable</li>
      <li>Consistent with prior law such as Lotus vs. Borland (can't copyright a menu structure)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Privacy</h1>
